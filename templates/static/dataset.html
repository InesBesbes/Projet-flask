        My name is Areej Wesleti. I am a junior in high school. I love painting since it's a good way to express your thoughts, reading books, and different articles especially about medical discoveries and the new developments brought to the field, I also love Photography. Meeting new people who support all my efforts to grow and develop my skills not only in the subjects but also in my hobbies gives me a lot of energy. Many of those friends who surround me now I met on the street while doing my hobby. Iâ€™m in love with photography, so the thing I love doing so much became even more enjoyable. I decided to take beautiful pictures of accidental people and share these photos with them by email or on social media. I feel satisfied inside seeing how happy they are looking at the pictures where they are walking or sitting somewhere in the park. <br> <br>
        
        As my life long dream, I want to join a medical university because my goal is to become a cardiothoracic surgeon in the future and to be a respected professional in the field. <br> <br>
        
        I find this study about life expectancy very salient since it represents my first step into the medical field, I loved finding out every single factor that was responsible for the high or low percentage of life expectancy in different countries ubiquitously and studying the different factors that contributed in it over the past decades.
